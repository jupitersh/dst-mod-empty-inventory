# Empty Inventory

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

It makes Players who are out of the white list empty their inventory and drop everything they have upon leaving, which protect your server from someone taking something important.

**Here are the usage of the mod**

Press `~` to open the console;

Execute `player()` to show the number of a specific player.

And of course, you can see the number on the list you see when pressing tab;

Execute `addlist(num)` to add a player to the white list;

Execute `rmlist(num)` to remove a player from the white list;

Execute `list()` to show the white list.

The player who is not in the server at present will not show in the white list.

**PS**

Defautly, no one is in the white, which means that everybody will drop stuffs.

If the admin shuts down the server when someone is still in the server, he/she will not drop his/her items.

To make sure that they drop, your should wait until they leave the server or just kick them.ðŸ˜‚
